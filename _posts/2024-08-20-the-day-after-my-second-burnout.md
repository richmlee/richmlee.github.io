# Stand-Up

Yesterday, I quit my job. ~Today~ This week, I'm going to document my personal thoughts, reflections, and learnings from this experience. No blockers.

# Burnout is Real

One of our team members posted "Burnout is Real" on the team's retrospective board a couple of months ago and he reminded us to take care of ourselves first - shortly before he unexpectedly left the company. I'm still not sure if this was him expressing his own burnout, a general statement for the team, specific individuals or just me, but I remember feeling better when he made that callout to the team. Plus, that day was the last day before I was taking a two-week break for my own burnout symptoms, and the rest of the day was already set up for the team and my return.

(I remembered this moment as I shared the news with him while writing this, but still think this is a sick intro. Keep in mind that this is my perspective only, with the facts I had up to this point, and considering without presumtion nor assumption as much as I can.)

The "tech industry" is a term that most people around me and on the internet don't really understand if they're not in it. It's not a private club or anything, nor a technical term within the stock market for the "tech sector". I would bet that you've met people who have this title though by now, and can personally confirm from 18 years that it comes with a high salary and great benefits. Corporations have the same job grade regardless of engineering and programming, and

nor necessarily the tech sector for public traders. Having a title including or relating to "Software Engineer" comes with a high pay and benefits, regardless of what skill is needed for the role. kjkk
Depending on the company, I have I've had experience in "Software Engineering" roles at corporations within the tech sector with job titles to match, for about 18 years or so by now. Most haven't required engineering, nor have discerned the roles, and the most successful skills were programming and corporate politics and/or image.

with burnout symptoms for over a year, and no one else had really brought it up. (Side note: Looking back, it's interesting that he was the one who wrote that or maybe I'm reflecting too hard.) Back to me though. That day was my last day before a planned 2-week work break, my longest one of the year so far and the most effective way my burnout symptoms clear before coming back.

Before I continue, I want to clarify that my goal of writing this is to capture my perspectives while they're still fresh within this state of mind, and something I hope I'd re-read some day. At the risk of over-explaining, this is just one perspective among many others for a shared experience. While I'll try my best to avoid any assumptions and presumptions, conclusions, and blame (besides myself), any analysis is probably intentional even if its incorrect, at least for now. Also, I really don't want to edit this much longer and need to move on.

Back to the story. I came back to work refreshed, I think. I spent my first day back catching up on Slack, and noted the lack of engineering progress while I was gone, and thought I reset too hard when I couldn't find the team member from that retro on Slack, until he told us that it was his last day at our daily standup. It was a big hit to our team, unexpected, and even though I was curious, I only wanted to know why, only if he wanted to share it with me. Later that day or the next day, may manager casually told me that our project was delayed another month or 2, and I reacted in frustration, either right before or after he also mentioned that we're receiving scrutiny by business management for not meeting our deadlines.

My focus at the time was clearing the team's critical-path tasks to keep the project moving, while working on mine, code pairing with our team's developers, and filling in gaps when I could, as did our manager. My awareness and information at the time was for the team to complete the remaining deliverables, and felt we were really on-track. I was letting quality slide for the project's progress, but was more vigilant in gatekeeping the potential bugs and risks that come with this, and avoid any rework that could add to our backlog and would push our timeline yet again, just later.

During the last 2 weeks on this team, I was an engineer for about 4 hours, and a programmer the rest. The first week, I received an usual amount of external pressure from my manager, on top of the self-pressure I had already. I already got the message when he started doing the "manager thing" of checking in too often when we've been in the same meetings since the last time he asked, and and escalated into insisting that I share my screen when I wasn't offering nor prepared in front of our teammates, along with unusual, rhetorical messages that can only give someone additional pressure or sense of urgency and were unrealistic to deliver, given the state I was in. I communicated that the screen sharing thing was emabarassing and uncomfortable after the first time, and reminded him how long we've worked together so that he can communicate like he had before, how I was already feeling pressure and stress, and that I felt insulted and disrespected. I understood his perspective and frustration having been in his role, and I expected that he'd see mine having been in my role. We were on a call with another teammate where I mentioned that this mode has been affecting my personal life.

The second week, I recognized the hard boundary between our two roles, and went into full code-monkey mode to throughout the weekend to meet the commitments I set to him, but being on my work laptop that long reminded me to be an engineer - something that I can't distinguish within myself. I hadn't given up on the team, and still felt that I had time to convince my manager of what could happen if we fall into this mode, but I also knew our two roles well enough to not enable nor encourage this behavior, and my motivation was not to quell this nor should be expected.

These timeline of these 2 weeks are still fuzzy, and the sequence of events may not be completely correct, but pretty close. After completing a set of functional PRs until Thursday, and appreciating how another engineer carved out the paths for my work, while dreading that it's held against me for not doing it at this point, I used AI to do most of my typing, dug up some personal automation scripts that I was filtering to share with other teammates, leaving each day for cleanup and test setups and a release schedule to control the pace for product managers.

I checked in with some teammates who were working and online, and

long makes it hard to ignore being a software engineer minI was in code-monkey mode when I wasn't helping my teammates, and those 2 weekends were the best time for it.e having been in my role.

I've held and today, still hold a lot of guilt and personal responsibility for many aspects of this team's output and its project's potential. I was still optimistic and thought we had time, so much so that I notified my manager that we should be careful for the ugly parts that can happen, but our communication was broken by then, and the project was already in the cycle bound by its inevitable trajectory (dibs if I'm the first to create this model formally):

    # todo:  mermaid this
    delays -> missed deadline and expectations to product and customers -> increased command-control management through the chain -> loss of confidence and trust for the team, and its individuals -> repeat

The project was in the cycle one would expect, and I assume there's a formal model for this somewheref you're into these kinds of models or worked on multiple projects, and Since then, the project inevitably reached its trajectory's cycle, which quickly turned into a negative spiral: delays -> missed deadline and expectations to product and customers -> increased command-control management through the chain -> loss of confidence and trust for the team, and its individuals.

by the time I recognized it, I was reaching out to the manager to be wary of how we handle this, and abolutely oblivious that we we're already there:

I was still optimistic at the time, at least in delivering the project goals from my purview. We've always been a fast-moving team and pretty autonomous, with a manager and engineer that I've been on this team with for my 4-year tenure. The team's culture was great and I think there was a "special sauce" in how many team members demonstrated ownership, pride, and care for the product we were building, maintaining and improving, and personal dedication that led to many successful and impacts. No one else seemed to think we wouldn't succeed, and I just needed time to deal with my personal feelings of the timeline being pushed once again.

about the product that we've been building, maintaining, and improving. . in tthat we cared about the product we were building and improving that were above and beyond, and that our past experiences, skillsets, and . use "agile" and "scrum" loosely as a process, and had always been autonomous. As corny as it sounds, I thought the "special sauce"

as much as I. ontinuing, I'm writing this to try and organize my own thoughts while they're fresh, and I don't intend to draw any conclusions, solutions, nor I'm not ready to draw any conclusions, the full picuture, nor any solutions right now, but I think there's value in capturing my perspective and experience while it's still fresh, in case it distorts in the future.

Trust and influence are important and provide more contextual awareness and are assets. Technical skills are commodities.

experienced my own burnout symptoms for over a year, and That day was also my last before taking 2 weeks off, which I expected to clear the burnout symptoms I've accumlated since my last break.

and the first timesomething I didn't expect he would ever say.because it was the day before a two-week work break - my longest one of the year, and what I believe had been effective for my burnout symptoms, just like it had for the past year or so. , and needed to clear my own burnout symptoms By then, I had recognized these symptoms and its effects on myself for over a year, and taking time off helped with these symptoms and I came back with a fresh focus and sometimes different perspectives that often felt like a restart.

and day, because it was the last day before I had planned a two-week work break and looked forward to clearing my own burnout symptoms.

I appreciated this comment, even though it was the last day before I'm still not sure if this was his way of expressing what he was going through, a general statement to the team, or even directed at me or someone else, but I appreciated the callout This happened on the last day before my planned two-week work break, and something I looked forward to for my burnout symptoms to clear.

wbreakwhere I was expecting my own burnout symptoms to clear, just like it had for the past year or so.

I just know that this callout happened at the last team retro before my planned break,

resonated even though it was my last day before I was about to take a two-week break. feeling comfort from this callout in front of the entire team. at the callout to our team. openly to the team, even though this was said on my last day before a two-week work break. Within the past year, taking time off helped clear any burnout symptoms I've had, and coming back afterwards felt like a reset or sometimes a fresh start for focus, self-reflection, and even renewed perspectives.

seemed to disappear, and , seemed to go away by taking time off, and what I would describe as a resetmy focus and perspective seemed to have "reset" when I return. This retro this was my last day before a two-week break - my longest of the year, and something that's helped any burnout symptoms over the past year.

I've already felt the symptoms for about a year, and taking time off from work seemed to help them go away. Plus, this retro happened the day before I planned a two-week break from work, where I'd take care of myself, and with plenty of time to return refreshed. I had a stacked set of PRs to unblock a teammate while I was away, set myself up for the next tasks for when I come back, turned off work-related notifications on my phone, before closing my laptop for the entire break.

don't know if this post was about himself, me, or just a general statement to the team, but the callout was strangely comforting at the time, and maybe prophetic today, if you're into that deep shit. By then, I've felt the symptoms for about year or so, but it was still manageable and consistent. Taking a day off here and there, resting and not thinking about work on weekends, spending time with friends and family was still effective as a "hard reset" to return to work with a clear mind, focus, confidence, and optimism. Plus, this retro post was right before I planned 2 weeks off, where I'd "take care of myself first" and have the hardest reset all year.

For some context, my 4-year tenure on this team was shared with my manager and a great engineer, as team members joined and left. The three of us who stayed together, with our various experiences, skillsets, strengths, and working styles that often complemented one another, had a special sauce in common : ownership and pride in the product we were building, and a self-imposed work ethic to back it up. As a fairly autonomous team, we maintained a culture of individual leadership and support for our team members by example and without expectation.

Before I left for my planned "reset", I wrote a set of stacked PRs that were blocking a teammate's work on the project, and had my work lined up for when I returned. The time off seemed to work, at least for a day or two. My first day back was mostly spent catching up on Slack, and seeing minimal progress on our engineering tickets while I was gone was curious, but didn't induce any stress or anxiety. This was also the day that the team member who wrote the retro post said his goodbyes. The next day, my manager told that the project timeline was pushed out by a month or 2, and that there'd be more scrutiny on our team because of another delay, and it quickly reverted the benefits of my time off.

Since then, the project inevitably reached its trajectory's cycle, which quickly turned into a negative spiral: delays -> missed deadline and expectations to product and customers -> increased command-control management through the chain -> loss of confidence and trust for the team, and its individuals.

The symptoms of burnout grew rapidly, negative feedback accumulated, and I finally became acutely aware of my personal life being impacted. I could only perceiving my manager's verbal frustrations as disrespectful, personal, and being seen as incompetent. My confidence as an engineer continued to drop with self-doubt and reinforced with every negative feedback, every mistake I'd make and negative thoughts of myself. Auto-pilot kicked in as a programmer, and I was in code-monkey mode for 2 weekends, appreciating the paths and patterns that were carved out for what I was doing, and simultaneously worrying about being scolded for not writing it. I was optimistic that our team would still succeed, and that the hard boundary of the roles between me and my manager. At this stage, I released PRs to maintain the expected velocity, holding chains of PRs locally, and using automation and AI for code, just to get ahead and decrease workload but deliver the same output. I planned to share some of these with my teammates and for them to share theirs, and help in saving their time wherever I can. As with everything else on this project, I was late in understanding the reality of our positions.

Was it burnout? It's still hard to say.

I've already experience one 10 years ago, and not sure and even if it was, this experience doesn't seem any different from the ones I've heard, found online, or the only other one I experienced 10 years ago. My reflections are to focus on things I learned about myself that I can work on peronally, and situations that I could have accepted, affected, taken a different course-of-action, reacted differently, or simply avoid the next time.

# Retrospective

With many other sharing this experience, I can obviously only write from my perspective, and will try to avoid any assumptions and presumptions of the other players. I'm also not going to propose any solutions make any analysis in order to place blame or fault. These are just my thoughts while they're still fresh on my mind.

1. Denial - Adapting to Changes Quicker and Accepting / Responding to Changes Effectively
   a. Addressing the burnout symptoms affecting my mood, behavior, work capacity along with its effects on myself, the team, and my teammates
   b. Accepting the team's actual work capacity when providing estimates after staff changes
   c. Overestimating my own capacity and maintaining strict time boundaries for teammates and my own focus time
   d. Confronting the reality or even the possibility of a failing project
   e.

2. Ego

3. Personal Boundaries & Association

This part is my personal growth, and Burnout symptoms can be self-induced without actually being burnout. and I'm not sure if the characterization matters. there are a lot of things I will continue to reflect upon from this experience. There's a lot I need to work on, and a lot that I'm proud of that I won't change.

are things about myself that Ineed to work on, and burnout would just be one factor. I tend to hold myself accountable for things I can control or do better, and high standards for the things I know I'm capable of, and could have led to burnout symptoms that were self-imposed.

I'm still not sure, but I learned a lot from this company, this team, the people I've worked with, and about myself, and there are always things to improve, accept, or considerion of more perspectives. I have only experienced it one other time, 10 years ago in my 18 years as a Software Engineer. Back then, I didn't have as many of the physical symptoms, and had external demands that I continued to take on, recognized that I checked out mentally, and able to spend 2 months giving passdowns to other engineers.

Having been in this pattern within a project beforeI tried to communicate the pattern we were in, and how things can get worse for us as a team, and that if we weren't careful, , I was too late, as with everything else lately.

Even recognizing that I could not be successful on this team any longer

was that we , but shared and most importantly the product we're building and improving.

I spent my 4-year tenure on this team with the same manager and a great engineer, as various team members came and left. The combination of my manager and a great engineer I worked Throughout my 4-year tenure on this team, on this team and with a manager who I worked with and made a strong partner, as well as a talented engineer

My role on this project has been a lead for the team's engineers, and although I've seen this cycle many times before, I've never had a solution nor recommendation to break it, yet know the limited ways this has played out before. Meanwhile, the burnout symptoms are getting worse: insomnia, inability to disconnect from work, being fully present with loved-ones, increased cynicism, physical sickness, feelings of isolation and loneliness, lowered self-confidence and self-esteem, and most of the other ones that come with it.

Besides myself, this has affected the people and situations around me, and the first time I truly acknowledged and accepted it at work was the Friday before I quit. Late, as usual by then.

# Retrospective

## this may be mushy, corny, or overly philosophical - lemme process my thoughts and feelings yo

Burnout doesn't just go away by quitting your job, and I expect this reflection to be colored by the self-doubt, blame, guilt and other emotions. Emotions subside with time, as will today's reflection if written in the future.

Keep in mind that this is a shared experience among many others, and any assumptions or presumptions here are mine. As the title states, I worked with great people at a great company with a culture that others around me still don't believe. I left with experiences, questions, learnings, and insights for myself, co-workers, project management, team dynamics, line-level managment, organizational dynamics, and much more.

I've been fortunate and grateful for the supportive and uplifting text messages and phone calls today.

the day after, and I've been lucky to receive supportive and caring text message and phone calls today which helped in framing my perspective and processing my emotions. Writing a reflection now are still colored by self-doubt, blame, guilt, and other emotions, which subside with time, just like the integrity of this viewpoint.

What follows is my perspective only, and therefore, any assumptions/presumptions here may not be fact. I recognize that there are others perspectives for this shared experience, and information I don't have. I'll try to exclude those factors as much as I can, and just capture my analysis and learnings, but keep that in mind.

As the title says, this was a job I loved, at a company that was special in ways that my friends and family still don't understand or believe. (They also know that I'm cynical to drink the Kool-Aid, even if it's sugar-free.) The changes within the company weren't new to me, and the culture and people kept me hooked.

I landed on the team I left for about 4 years, give or take, and shuffled around other teams while the org structure for the engineering orgs settled. I joined right before the team was tasked to rewrite an existing SaaS product, and new functionality with requirements I eventually expected to be in flux.

These are my honest viewpoints and perspective today, and my assumptions and/or presumptions which may not necessarily be factual, but true in my perpsective of shared experiences:

# Retrospective

One of my favorite aspects of being a Software Engineer (within the tech industry at least) is the power and control we have on machines, and the impact this has for businesses, developers, and users that depend on what we create. In this industry, this requires the collaboration of many stakeholders, whose diverse contributions have led to unique and customized solutions. As an engineer, structuring and implmenting this solution using past/existing/new

Whether an engineer or developer or both, implmenting these solutions require continuous learning, existing knowledge, and creativity are knowledge-based and creative, and solutions to the same problem aren't always the same (except for college students I've tutored.)

Most of the time, this requires a collaboration among engineers and stakeholders with various specialties and backgrounds, which results in custom solutions for similar problems.

    is how our contributions combined with other stakeholders   , is that it's knowledge work requiring collaboration with other Software Engineers with varying specialties and backgrounds.  (And we get paid to do it.)

# Some Background

I have a college degree in Operations Resarch / Industrial Engineering, a Master's in Computer Science, and have had an 18 year career as a Software Engineer. I've primarily worked for tech companies, spanning leadership and individual contributor roles, in order to deliver desktop, web, and mobile apps.

I've been a Software Engineer for 18 years, and a programmer a years longer. My professional experience spans most roles in business and technical leadership and every part of the SDLC for business applications for desktop, mobile, and web, from bootstrapped startups to enterprise corporations. I have a passion for system and software architecture and design, and finding solutions to meet business objectives with an eye on improving developer experience and workflow to achieve and maintain these.

and My experience has been primarily for business applications

but I've been a programmer even longer.

I've always been passionate about system and software architecture, programming, and solving business problems with software. by leading teams or individual contribution.

For the last 4 and half years, I worked at an amazing company with a mission I believe in, and a culture driven by some of the brightest and driven people in the industry. I still can't describe how special this place is to my family and friends who know that I don't "just drink the Kool-Aid", even if it's sugar-free.

mid-acquisition for the team I was hired for, right before the Covid shutdowns, and I was re-shuffled among a few teams as the org restructurings among various teams as the company grew and became publicly traded.

## The original rewrite / beta testing / impelmentation limitations

I've led a team of engineers for about 3.5 years, to rewrite and re-develop an existing product to gain more customers and users. The team was able to work through ambiguity, new and evolving product requirements, and deliver a beta version.

This product includes your typical SaaS application feature: a Web UI to display a table with many rows and columns. This was implemented in ReactJS and AG-Grid for table implementation, and did not consider large data sets nor alternatives for a different architecture for this type of Web UI. There was also an in-house middle layer that was de-facto, and limited decisions for alternatives (i.e. Server-Side Rendering, HTMX, etc.)

Two significant performance issues and intractable scalability issues were identified during beta, about 3 years later requiring a design pivot within the existing design: data fetching and user wait time for page load

The Server-Side data fetching was always known to be non-performant due to the degree of associations from its domain aggregate, and something to resolve and design for scalability.

The Web UI was not able to render without fetching the complete dataset, and was more urgent to address for users.

This pivot caused a new project and technical plan, to implement a new design with the benefits of no new feature requirements, while supporting the beta version. During this time, the team members changed

I took a job offer that was a great match for what I was seeking in my next role, from a company that is truly special in its culture and values. I was skeptical at first, but quickly fell in love without drinking any Kool-Aid. As the company grew, we were shuffled among teams, and I got to meet and work with some of the brightest and friendliest engineers in the field.

Since 2020 or so, I landed on a product team that was going to rewrite and improve the existing one. This included user enhancements, UI redesigns, and progressing towards a monolith -> microservices architecture with domain-driven design.

The team consisted of the typical tripod (PM, UX, EM), with Software Engineers split for Backend / Frontend development. The supportiveness, collaboration, and engagment of each team member was truly remarkable and special. As the Engineering Lead on this team, I would partner with the EM, and as an Engineer, we were able to adapt to abstract and changing requirements, make impactful individual contributions, and develop within our careers.

# Post-Mortem: Reflections and Learnings

I've been fortunate in my career thus far to be able to take time off between jobs

# Takeaways

I'm going to use this time off figuring out what I want to do next, consulting with my mentors for more perspectives, and taking care of myself both mentally and physically. Today, I'm finally getting a haircut that's been about 2 months overdue.
